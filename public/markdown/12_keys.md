# Keys

> _Organizing and Accessing Data with Key-Value Pairs_

## Introduction

In _bell_, **keys** are a way to associate labels (_keys_) with values, creating so-called key-value pairs. Keys are particularly useful for organizing data in a structured and readable way. In musical contexts, keys can label chords, instruments, dynamics, or even entire sections of a composition, making your code more intuitive and easier to manage.

## What Are Keys?

A key-value pair in _bell_ is a data structure that associates a key (symbol) with a value. This is similar to dictionaries or associative arrays in other programming languages.

### Syntax:

```c
[ <key1> <value1> ] [ <key2> <value2> ] ... [ <keyN> <valueN> ]
```

### Example:

```py
$chord = ['tonic' C4 E4 G4];
```

Here:

- `'tonic'` is the key.
- `C4 E4 G4` is the value.

## Accessing Keys

You can retrieve a value associated with a key using the dot operator (.).

### Example: Accessing Chords by Key

```py
$chords = ['tonic' C4 E4 G4] ['dominant' G4 B4 D5];
print($chords.'tonic'); ## Outputs: C4 E4 G4
print($chords.'dominant'); ## Outputs: G4 B4 D5
```

## Adding and Modifying Key-Value Pairs

You can add or update key-value pairs dynamically.

### Example: Adding Keys

```py
$chords = [];
$chords += ['tonic' C4 E4 G4];
$chords += ['dominant' G4 B4 D5];
print($chords); ## Outputs: ['tonic' C4 E4 G4] ['dominant' G4 B4 D5]
```

### Example: Modifying Values

```py
$chords = ['tonic' C4 E4 G4];
$chords += ['tonic' C3 E3 G3]; ## Updates the value for 'tonic'
print($chords.'tonic'); ## Outputs: C3 E3 G3
```

## Examples in Musical Contexts

### Labeling Chords in a Progression

```py
$progression = ['tonic' C4 E4 G4] ['subdominant' F4 A4 C5] ['dominant' G4 B4 D5];
print($progression.'subdominant'); ## Outputs: F4 A4 C5
```

### Assigning Dynamics to a Melody

```py
$melody = ['phrase1' [C4 D4 E4]] ['phrase2' [F4 G4 A4]];
$dynamics = ['phrase1' mf] ['phrase2' p];
print($dynamics.'phrase1'); ## Outputs: mf
```

## Keys with Nested Structures

You can combine keys with nested lists for more complex data structures.

### Example: Organizing a Score

```
$score = [
    'section1' [[C4 E4 G4] [F4 A4 C5]],
    'section2' [[G4 B4 D5] [A4 C5 E5]]
];
print($score.'section1'); ## Outputs: [[C4 E4 G4] [F4 A4 C5]]
print($score.'section2':2:1); ## Outputs: A4
```

## Iterating Over Keys

You can use a loop to iterate through the keys in a list of key-value pairs.

### Example: Printing All Keys and Values

```py
$chords = ['tonic' C4 E4 G4] ['dominant' G4 B4 D5];
for $key in $chords::keys do (
    print($key);
    print($chords.$key);
);
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Chord Dictionary

1. Create a llll of key-value pairs for a chord progression:

```py
$progression = ['tonic' C4 E4 G4] ['dominant' G4 B4 D5];
```

2. Access and print:
   - The tonic chord.
   - The dominant chord.

### Exercise 2: Organizing a Melody with Dynamics

1. Create a llll for a melody and its dynamics:

```py
$melody = ['phrase1' [C4 D4 E4]] ['phrase2' [F4 G4 A4]];
$dynamics = ['phrase1' mf] ['phrase2' p];
```

2. Print:

- The notes and dynamics of phrase1.
- The notes and dynamics of phrase2.

### Exercise 3: Nested Score Structure

1. Create a nested score with sections labeled as keys:

```py
$score = [
    'intro' [[C4 E4 G4] [F4 A4 C5]],
    'verse' [[G4 B4 D5] [A4 C5 E5]]
];
```

2. Access and print:

- All chords in the intro.
- The first chord in the verse.

### Exercise 4: Iterating Over Sections

1. Use a loop to print all section labels and their corresponding data in a score:

```py
$score = [
    'chorus' [[C4 D4 E4] [F4 G4 A4]],
    'bridge' [[A4 B4 C5] [D5 E5 F5]]
];
```

Example Output:

```lua
chorus: [[C4 D4 E4] [F4 G4 A4]]
bridge: [[A4 B4 C5] [D5 E5 F5]]
```

## FAQ

### Q: Can keys contain special characters or spaces?

**A**: Keys can contain special characters but not spaces unless enclosed in quotes:

```py
$example = ['key1' value1] ['key with spaces' value2];
```

### Q: How do I check if a key exists?

**A**: Use the ::keys function to list all keys and check for membership:

```py
$chords = ['tonic' C4 E4 G4];
print('tonic' in $chords::keys); ## Outputs: true
```

### Q: Can I store a null value in a key?

**A**: Yes, you can associate null with a key, which is useful for placeholders:

```py
$data = ['missing' null];
print($data.'missing'); ## Outputs: null
```
