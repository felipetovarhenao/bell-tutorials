# Keys

> _Organizing and Accessing Data with Key-Value Pairs_

In _bell_, **keys** are a way to associate labels (_keys_) with values, creating so-called _key-value_ pairs. Keys are particularly useful for organizing data in a structured and readable way. In musical contexts, keys can label chords, instruments, dynamics, or even entire sections of a composition, making your code more intuitive and easier to manage.

## What Are Keys?

A key-value pair in _bell_ is a data structure that associates a key with a value. This is similar to dictionaries or associative arrays in other programming languages.

### Syntax:

```c
[ <key1> <value1> ] [ <key2> <value2> ] ... [ <keyN> <valueN> ]
```

### Example:

```py
$chord = ['tonic' C4 E4 G4]
```

**Here**:

- `'tonic'` is the key.
- `C4 E4 G4` is the value.

Note that, even though keys are usually symbols, they can be any data type (excluding lists).

```py
$chord [1 C4 E4 G4]
```

**Here**:

- `1` is the key.
- `C4 E4 G4` is the value.

In other words, the first value within any bracketed list can serve or be thought of as that list's key.

## Accessing Keys

You can retrieve a value associated with a key using the dot operator (`.`).

### Example: Accessing Chords by Key

```py
$chords = ['tonic' C4 E4 G4] ['dominant' G4 B4 D5];
print($chords.'tonic'); ## Outputs: C4 E4 G4
print($chords.'dominant'); ## Outputs: G4 B4 D5
```

## Adding and Modifying Key-Value Pairs

You can update key-value pairs through variable assignments.

### Example: Updating Values Via Keys

```py
$chords = ['chord1' C4 E4 G4] ['chord2' D4 F4 A4];
$chords."chord1" = D4 G4 B4;
print($chords); ## Outputs: ['chord1' D4 G4 B4] ['chord2' D4 F4 A4]
```

To update single values, you can also combine the dot (`.`) and access (`:`) operators.

```py
$chords = ['chord1' C4 E4 G4] ['chord2' D4 F4 A4];
$chords."chord2":3 = Ab4;
print($chords."chord2"); ## Outputs: D4 F4 Ab4
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Access Chord Progression

1. Create a _llll_ of _key-value_ pairs for a chord progression:

```py
$progression = ['tonic' C4 E4 G4] ['subdominant' F4 A4 C5] ['dominant' G4 B4 D5];
```

2. Use `.` and `:` operators to access and print:
   - The tonic chord.
   - The second note of the subdominant chord.
   - The first note of the dominant chord.

### Exercise 2: Update Chord Progression

1. Create a _llll_ of _key-value_ pairs for a chord progression:

```py
$progression = ['tonic' C4 E4 G4] ['subdominant' F4 A4 C5] ['dominant' G4 B4 D5];
```

2. Use the `.` and `:` operators to change the progression from major to minor. You should only update the third of each chord.

## FAQ

### Q: Can keys contain special characters or spaces?

**A**: Keys can contain special characters but not spaces unless enclosed in quotes:

```py
$example = ['key1' value1] ['key with spaces' value2];
```

### Q: What happens when I try to access a key that doesn't exist?

**A**: The expression evaluates to `null`.

```py
$example = ['Kaija' 'Papillon'] ['Chaya' 'Sahaf'];
print($example."Salvatore") ## Outputs: null
```

### What happens when I try to update the value of a non-existent key?

**A**: It ignores the assignment, keeping the _llll_ unchanged.

```py
$x = ["key1" 1];
$x."key2" = 2;
print($x) ## [ "key1" 1 ]
```

### Q: Can I store a null value in a key?

**A**: Yes, you can associate `null` with a key, which is useful for placeholders:

```py
$data = ['missing' null];
print($data.'missing'); ## Outputs: null
$data."missing" = "just kidding!";
print($data) ## Outputs: [ "missing" "just kidding!" ]
```

### Q: How do I check if a key exists?

**A**: One way is to check if the value for that key is `null`:

```py
$chords = ['tonic' C4 E4 G4];
print($chord."dominant" == null) ## Outputs: 1
```

However, this is somewhat limited, since it can also mean that the key exists but currently has no value associated with it:

```py
$chords = ['tonic' C4 E4 G4] ['dominant'];
print($chord."dominant" == null) ## Outputs: 1
```

To truly check if a key doesn't exist, it would likely involve iterating through the _llll_, which will be covered in the [loops](17_loops.md) tutorial.

By mastering keys, you can create clean and efficient data structures that are both easy to read and manipulate. Next, weâ€™ll dive into list operators, which provide powerful tools for working with sequences and repetitions in _bell_.
