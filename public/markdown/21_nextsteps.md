# Next steps

Congratulations on completing this introduction to _bell_. While this tutorial series has laid a solid foundation, there are still many aspects of _bell_ that we didn't get to take a closer look at. Whether you’re eager to dive into _bellplay~_ or _bach_, here are some suggested next steps to guide your learning process.

## Explore the documentation

The resources within this tutorial series and beyond provide in-depth guidance on specific aspects of _bell_.

### 1. Reference the _bell_ functions appendix

Here you can find a [documented list of all built-in functions](/#/reference) in _bell_. Use it as a reference when writing your own scripts—it’s particularly useful when you encounter a function you’re unfamiliar with or need a reminder of argument names and behaviors.

### 2. Dive into the built-in _bellplay~_ tutorials

If you plan to continue your work with _bellplay~_, the built-in tutorials included in the application are a great next step. These tutorials offer hands-on guidance tailored to the _bellplay~_ environment, helping you levarage your _bell_ skills for algorithmic audio and sound design.

### 3. The official bach documentation

For users interested in the broader capabilities of _bach_, the official _bach_ documentation is essential. It covers topics and features beyond the scope of these tutorials, including advanced integration with _Max_ and the other _bach_-related libraries.

## Broaden your knowledge of CAC

Understanding _bell_ is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to computer-assisted composition. Expanding your theoretical and creative knowledge will help you unlock the full potential of this powerful tool.

### 1. Read introductory books on CAC

Books like Örjan Sandred’s _The Musical Fundamentals of Computer Assisted Composition_ provide an excellent introduction to CAC concepts and practices. By deepening your understanding of algorithmic composition techniques, you’ll be better equipped to design creative workflows with _bell_.

### 2. Experiment and learn by doing

Sometimes, the best way to learn is by experimenting. Try combining the techniques you’ve learned here to create something new—a generative melody, a rhythmic pattern, or even a full composition. Each experiment will help reinforce your skills and reveal new possibilities.

### Final words

This is just the beginning. The unique blend of simplicity and power in _bell_ opens up a world of creative opportunities for algorithmic composition. Whether you choose to focus on _bellplay_, explore _bach_, or expand your knowledge of CAC, the tools and communities are out there to support you every step of the way.

**Happy composing!**
